The plan for this project is to create a file hosting database where files can be both uploaded and downloaded.

First a basic server will be needed that will receive data and write it to a file.
The server will also need to read from local files to send to the client.

A client program will also be needed to connect to the server. The client will send and recieves files from the server.

Future improvements include:
- being able to specify a user to store files under
- having password credentials for user
- server sending a list of available files
- support multiple connections at once.

The goal is to have a file hosting server written with what I have learned in class.
